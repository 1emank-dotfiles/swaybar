# 1emank's Sway+Waybar dotfiles

## Requirements

Everything is optional:

- `make`: To take advantage of the Makefile
- `rsync`: Same as above. It will install the files.
- `git`: To clone the repo and for the git integration
- `tree`: (Very optional) See `make tree` in this README

## Instructions

You are free to do whatever you want with the files. Inspect, copy, paste,
partially or completely. But I recommend you to use the Makefile because it provides
the following commands.

If you use the Makefile you need to know about the watchlist file. It declares
the files and directories to be copied. The syntax is the following:

```
#/absolute/path
foo/bar
baz
```

The relative paths are interpreted as relative to `#/absolute/path`. You can
use POSIX variable expansion in the absolute path, like `#$HOME` or
`#$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/subdir`.

IMPORTANT: All items must end without slash "/"

### Main commands

- `make tree` (or just `make`): You'll see an overview of the file tree that
  would be installed (needs the `tree` command).

- `make install`: It will make a backup of your files and it will install the
  files of the repo.

- `make recover`: To uninstall the repo files and deploy your backup.

### Other

Some of this commands run automatically as a requirement for other commands.

- `make backup`: To make a backup manually.

- `make deploy`: To install without doing a backup.

- `make deps`: To check dependencies, if you fulfill the requirements, nothing
  will happen.

- `make repo`: To modify repo with your files.

- `make valid_root`: To test if your watchlist has a valid root defined in the first line
